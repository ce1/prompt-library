# Eggi's prompt library

Hey, this is my personal prompt library. I'm just sharing it in case it's useful for you.

It's a mix of prompts I've created myself and prompts I've found around the internet. I'll give attribution when possible. 

## How to use

Just copy the prompt you want to use and paste it into the LLM you're using.

PS: Check you langdock.com if your company doesn't use LLMs at scale yet. It's the the all-in-one AI platform for your company.
