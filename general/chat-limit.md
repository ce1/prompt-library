When you hit your chat limit, replace your last chat bubble (using the ✏️ icon on any LLM) with the following:

❮❮❮ This conversation has reached its context limit. Create a document that can serve as the initial context for a fresh blank LLM thread. Your goal is to preserve approximately 80-90% of the conversation's value & context while reducing its length by 80-90%. 
Act as an expert addressing another expert who will help me, and want to set them up for maximum success to be as close as possible to having been there all along. Tell a chronological story. Use your best judgment when it would be particularly valuable to use the original exact words of either the user or AI. 
(Skip any context that is already found in the project knowledge, since this will be available automatically to the new thread.) 
Create a second, separate document with what you chose not to include, and why. ❯❯❯
